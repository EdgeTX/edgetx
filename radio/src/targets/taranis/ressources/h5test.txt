STM32H562 DMA
Channel 0 to 3
FIFO of 8 bytes, 2 words–fixed/contiguously incremented addressing
These channels must be typically allocated for GPDMA transfers
between an APB or AHB peripheral and SRAM.

Channel 4 and 5
FIFO of 32 bytes, 8 words–fixed/contiguously incremented addressing
 These channels may be used for GPDMA transfers between a
demanding AHB peripheral and SRAM, or for transfers from/to external
memories

Channel 6 and 7
FIFO of 32 bytes, 8 words–2D addressing
 These channels may be used for GPDMA transfers between a
demanding AHB peripheral and SRAM, or for transfers from/to external
memories
