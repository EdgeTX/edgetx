File    : SEGGER_SYSVIEW_Conf.h
Purpose : SEGGER SystemView configuration file.
          Set defines which deviate from the defaults (see SEGGER_SYSVIEW_ConfDefaults.h) here.          
Revision: $Rev: 25331 $

Additional information:
  Required defines which must be set are:
    SEGGER_SYSVIEW_GET_TIMESTAMP
    SEGGER_SYSVIEW_GET_INTERRUPT_ID
  For known compilers and cores, these might be set to good defaults
  in SEGGER_SYSVIEW_ConfDefaults.h.
  
  SystemView needs a (nestable) locking mechanism.
  If not defined, the RTT locking mechanism is used,
  which then needs to be properly configured.
